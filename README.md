What is REST? 

>Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for web-based ?communication that permits clients to talk to servers in a unique fashion. In particular, REST represents resources within a given server as uniform resource identifiers (URIs), simplifying the implementation of REST architectures on the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP).
